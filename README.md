Armature Refresh (Blender Script)
=================================

Blender script that refresh incorrect armature positions before rendering current frame. This tiny script could fix your problems if your rig doesn't update itself correctly before you're rendering it.

## How to Use

This script meant to drive before rendering, so I used it through **command line** in Windows. I write blog post about ["Render From Command Line"](http://niittymaa.com/blog/blender/render-from-command-line/). You just need simple command to run script with rendering process:

`blender -b FILENAME.blend -P ArmatureRefresh.py`

## About

I made some cleaning process in my scripts folder. Found this tiny script and want to store it here. I face this problem in 2012 on some project, so I'm not sure if this script is still useful. Please, send me a mail if it still work and you find it useful.
